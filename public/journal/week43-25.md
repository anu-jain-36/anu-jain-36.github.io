## Tue, Oct 21 | Visa rules and Networking
I dug deep on the update provided by USCIS on H1B visas. USCIS clarified that the 100k fee is not applicable for "change of status" cases i.e. this fee  is not applicable when changing from F1 to H1B visa. I learnt more about the H1B wage based lottery. I also explored the proposed change in the "duration of stay" rule for F1 visas even though it does not concern me directly.  
I also put my REST API certification on linkedin.I cleared the test 💪  
Today was my "networking" day.🤝 I sent messages to people and spoke to them on call. I gave them updates on my job search and asked them for their updates. I have gotten around six leads to follow up on and schedule calls with.  
Networking is always harder for me than working on projects or studying. It is a skill of its own and I am getting better at it.  
My goal is to follow up with these leads. This is going to be my primary task for the remainder of this week.

I revised and practiced inserting and searching with **Tires** - a data structure also called prefix-tree. Its most common use case is autofill.
