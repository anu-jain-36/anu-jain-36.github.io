## Monday, October 13 | Microservices Architecture Planning

Started the week by designing the architecture for our new microservices-based system. Spent time researching best practices for service decomposition and identifying bounded contexts within our monolithic application. Created initial diagrams showing service boundaries, API contracts, and data ownership patterns.

## Tuesday, October 14 | Spring Boot Service Development

Built the first microservice using Spring Boot. Implemented REST endpoints with proper error handling and validation. Set up Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration management. Added Actuator endpoints for health checks and monitoring. The service is lightweight and starts up in under 3 seconds.

## Wednesday, October 15 | Service Discovery with Eureka

Implemented Netflix Eureka for service discovery. This eliminates the need for hardcoded service URLs and enables dynamic scaling. Each microservice now registers itself with the Eureka server on startup. Tested failover scenarios and verified that services can discover each other reliably.

## Thursday, October 16 | Containerization with Docker

Dockerized all microservices with multi-stage builds to optimize image sizes. Created Docker Compose files for local development environment setup. Implemented health checks in Dockerfiles and configured resource limits. The entire stack can now be spun up locally with a single command.

## Friday, October 17 | API Gateway Implementation

Set up Spring Cloud Gateway as the entry point for all client requests. Configured routing rules, rate limiting, and circuit breakers. Implemented JWT authentication at the gateway level. Added request/response logging for debugging. The gateway provides a unified interface while hiding the complexity of our microservices architecture.

## Weekend Reflection | Key Learnings & Next Steps

This week was incredibly productive. Moving from a monolithic architecture to microservices requires careful planning, but the benefits are already evident - independent deployment, better scalability, and technology flexibility. Next week, I'll focus on implementing inter-service communication patterns, adding distributed tracing with Zipkin, and deploying to AWS ECS.
