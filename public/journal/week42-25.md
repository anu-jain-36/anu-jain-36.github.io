## Mon, Oct 13 | Scaling in Software Systems 
System Design is the core for Software Engineering. It is asked during interviews. SDEs have been asked about designing chat-GPT and leetcode. 

I started studying 'System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide by Alex Wu'. I got through the first chapter - where I learnt about vertical and horizontal scaling, Load balancers, load and response times, web tier, cache tier, CDNs,caching policies,  Database scaling, Redundancy in databases, Sharding, read replicas, leader-follower architecture, Single point of failure, CAP theorem, consistent Hashing, types of NoSQL databases, Data centers, stateful and stateless servers, Geo DNS, Messaging queues,  Error logging, monitoring and continuous Integration. 

I knew a lot of it from my time spent on Google cloud as well as just being a developer.  This was a great and comprehensive introduction. This was a very birdâ€™s eye POV chapter. I have many questions - like how do you decide on the number of read replicas, how do software engineers choose between AP, CP or CA databases for their application. I am looking forward to the future chapters. 


## Tue, Oct 14 | Dynamic Routes, Parsing Mark down files and React 

My personal website is a static website. I built it to find a job fast. I thought of journaling my daily learnings as a way of bringing clarity, daily motivation and celebration. 
I wanted to add a weekly entry. To create a new webpage for every week is non-scalable. So I designed the system so that there is a readme file for each week, which gets parsed and presented on a dynamic path /journal/week#year# automatically. So I could just add to the readme file and commit. 

I ran into an error of using two routing libraries together- react-router-dom and wouter. I ended up using wouter for everything as it is lightweight and apt for a personal websites. I can now consistently journal my progress and stay motivated on this journey.
